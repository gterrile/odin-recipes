  <h3 class="recipe-h3">About this recipe</h3>
  <P class="center-margin">Savory fillings rolled up in soft tortillas, lined up in a casserole dish, covered in sauce, topped with cheese, and baked until hot and bubbly â€” what's not to love?! Add a dollop of sour cream or a spoonful of fresh guacamole, and you've got a never-fail, family-pleasing meal. Let's break down the components and dish up some top-rated Enchilada recipes.</P>
  <p class="center-margin">This classic Tex-Mex dish is one of America's original fusion foods, the delicious result of a mingling of Mexican, Native American, Texas cowboy, and Anglo cultures. As such, enchiladas are by nature incredibly versatile. They take deliciously to a variety of fillings: shredded meats like beef, pork, or chicken, as well as meat-free fillings like beans, sour cream, or cheese.</p>
